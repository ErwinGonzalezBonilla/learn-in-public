  focus: Full Stack Developer
  summary: |
    I’m currently a Full Stack web development student at 4Geeks Academy, combining my background in socio-cultural management with my growing skills in web development. I graduated as a Project Manager from the Central University of Venezuela, and have worked at Fundamusical - the National System of Youth and Children’s Orchestras of Venezuela. Additionally, I’m a trumpet player with studies in Arts, Cultural Management, and Music.

    I am now focused on enhancing my programming skills and building impactful web projects, while continuing to manage cultural projects.
